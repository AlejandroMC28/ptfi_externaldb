# Mapping the Origins of Molecular Signals in Food

**Alejandro Mendoza Cantu, Julia M. Gauglitz, Wout Bittremieux**

Integrative analysis of the PTFI dataset, linking ~24,000 molecular features across 500 foods to curated chemical databases.

## Overview

Analysis of xenobiotic compounds, fluorinated substances, and bioactive molecules in food using untargeted LC-MS metabolomics data from the Periodic Table of Food Initiative and external chemical databases.
